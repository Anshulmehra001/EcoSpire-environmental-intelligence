# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of six critical environmental features in EcoSpire: FloraShield (invasive species detection), Food Waste Reduction (surplus food redistribution), Environmental Justice (community impact mapping), EcoSonification (environmental data through sound), Phantom Footprint (hidden environmental impact tracking), and Upcycling Agent (creative waste transformation). The goal is to create a cohesive, professional-grade user experience that matches the design patterns established in other EcoSpire tools while significantly expanding functionality and impact.

The enhanced features will provide real-time environmental monitoring, community-driven data collection, creative engagement tools, and actionable insights that empower users to make meaningful environmental and social impact through multiple sensory and analytical approaches.
