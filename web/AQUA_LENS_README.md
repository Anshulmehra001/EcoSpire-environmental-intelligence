# 🧪 Aqua-Lens: AI Water Quality Guardian

## Overview

Aqua-Lens transforms a simple 50-cent paper test strip into a lab-grade water analysis tool using smartphone camera and AI, creating a crowd-sourced, real-time map of water quality.

## 🎯 The Problem

Water quality testing is either expensive and slow (lab tests) or cheap but inaccurate (manual reading of color-changing test strips). There's no way to get reliable, instant, localized water quality data.

## 💡 The Solution

Instead of building expensive new hardware, Aqua-Lens massively upgrades the cheapest existing hardware. The human eye is terrible at distinguishing shades of color, but a phone camera combined with AI is incredibly precise.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Standardized Test**: User dips a common, multi-parameter water test strip into a water source
2. **AI-Calibrated Scan**: Open the app, place the wet strip on a white reference card, take a photo
3. **Image Analysis**: AI instantly isolates colored pads, analyzes precise RGB/HSV values, corrects for lighting
4. **Accurate Results**: Compares values to pre-calibrated model, outputs precise numerical results
5. **Alert & Map**: Geotagged data uploads to live map, triggers automatic alerts for dangerous levels

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **AquaLens.js** - Main React component with professional UI
- **imageAnalysis.js** - Canvas-based color analysis engine
- **waterQualityDatabase.js** - IndexedDB storage system
- **waterQualityMapping.js** - Geospatial analysis and mapping

### Backend Components (Optional)
- **Node.js API Server** - Express.js REST API
- **Python AI Analysis** - OpenCV-based computer vision
- **C++ Image Processing** - High-performance preprocessing
- **SQLite Database** - Comprehensive data storage

## 🧪 Water Parameters Analyzed

1. **pH Levels** (4.0-9.0) - Acidity/alkalinity measurement
2. **Chlorine** (0-4 ppm) - Disinfection levels
3. **Nitrates** (0-50 ppm) - Contamination indicator
4. **Water Hardness** (0-300 ppm) - Mineral content
5. **Alkalinity** (0-240 ppm) - Buffer capacity
6. **Bacteria** (0/1) - Biological contamination

## 🎨 Color Calibration

The system uses scientifically accurate color calibration based on actual test strip chemistry:

- **pH**: Red (acidic) → Yellow → Green → Blue (alkaline)
- **Chlorine**: Clear → Pink → Red (increasing concentration)
- **Nitrates**: Clear → Pink → Red (contamination levels)
- **Hardness**: Clear → Green (soft to hard water)
- **Alkalinity**: Clear → Blue/Cyan (buffer capacity)
- **Bacteria**: Clear (safe) → Colored (contaminated)
